- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SmugSanae
- Interests include programming, gaming, and looking for ways to combine those two interests to make a living.
- Iâ€™m currently learning a couple of languages, but C++ is my priority.
- I'm hoping to land a job as an IT specialist, and eventually moving my way up to sysadmin after a couple years.
- More to be added at a later date...
